# IPA shortcuts
A semi-handy way of typing IPA characters anywhere.

## Introduction
This AutoHotkey script was created to make typing IPA symbols a lot easier. Whilst not the most fst solution, it provides the necessary functionality, whilst requiring very little habituation, as it follows the usual order.

The current system works the like this: <br>
[voicing] [place of articulation] [manner of articulation]


## Using non-spacing diacritics
Diactritics are proceded by two underscores(__) insted of one.

When typing non-spacing diacritics the order in which the symbols are entered matters. This is not an issue with monospaced fonts, such as this one.

It varies with the font, however, I find, that typing the diacritic followed the other character (without a space in-between), works the best.

Exeption: Reversed with tie bar.

## Examples
```_voiced bilabial trill``` becomes: ```ʙ``` <br>

```b__voiced``` becomes: ```b̬``` <br>
